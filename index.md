# Artemis Fowl

Artemis Fowl II is the son of Artemis Fowl I and Angeline Fowl. He has two younger brothers Beckett and Myles, who are twins. 
Artemis' birthday is 1st of September. He uses his intelligence to build his family fortune through crime. This steams from
his family, who have been criminals for generations. Artemis is cold, cynical, and often outright ruthless in his manipulation 
of people for his own ends. The Fowls are a family of "legendary criminals" whose history dates back to at least the Norman
Conquest that have amassed a fortune through both legitimate and illegitimate means. Working alongside the Fowls is a Butler
family, a centuries-old line of trained bodyguards that form lifelong affiliations with members of the Fowl family.
